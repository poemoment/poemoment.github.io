// Numbers shown in the homepage Site stats panel that aren't derivable

// - `visitors`: from the Vercel Web Analytics dashboard
//   (Vercel Analytics dashboard). Vercel has
//   no public read API for these, no CLI command either.
// - `projects`: total count of entries on /projects.
//
// Page views aren't stored here — SiteStats fetches the live total from
// the waline server's /api/stats endpoint instead.
